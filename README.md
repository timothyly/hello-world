First repository
Hello world,

This is an original attempt at providing a repository to practice on BI. I am new to coding, but have done many hours of classwork and research to learn the skill of being a Data Scientist. I truly love research and learning how and why situations happen or do not happen. My first study was to see how students reacted to a police officer being present in a classroom effected test scores. I already knew that students would get lower scores with the officer in the room. That is why I had to manipulate the experiment and throw in my own twist, a police officer with a gun. Of course, this yielded even lower scores from students because they were wondering why an officer was allowed to have a gun on campus. 

With this being said, how do we prepare for unknowns? Do we know our next steps in case an unknown happens? As humans, are we truly knowledgable of what can or cannot be accomplished? There are so many of these types of questions that can be answered with manipulation of data. By creating scenarios we can prepare for the unknown of life.
